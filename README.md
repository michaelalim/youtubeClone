# youtubeClone
currently making a youtube clone 

- planning to make a youtube clone only using html and css
- inspired by the web dev simplified. It has a youtube channel if you want to see: https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified. Their content is mostly web-dev, mostly css, but they cover a lot of other things.
- might consider improving mine by adding a little bit of javascript if ever i get to finish the task

### September 6

- totally discarded the idea of exclusively using html and css for the project and added lots of javascript in the coding. The idea is that javascript would make my project easier to maintain in a practical scenario instead of purely using html and css. This will also give me a lot of practice in terms of coding in javascript.
- also planning on making lots of other pages and give functions to most if not all of the buttons
